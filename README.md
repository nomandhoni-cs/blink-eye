## The 20-20-20 Rule

The **20-20-20 rule** is a guideline to reduce eye strain caused by staring at screens for extended periods. It suggests that for every **20 minutes** spent looking at a screen, you should take a **20-second break** and focus your eyes on something at least **20 feet away**.

### Benefits:

- **Reduces Eye Strain:** Regular breaks help prevent eye fatigue and strain caused by prolonged screen time.
- **Improves Focus:** Taking short breaks can help maintain focus and productivity throughout the day.
- **Prevents Dry Eyes:** Looking away from the screen allows your eyes to blink more frequently, reducing the risk of dry eyes.
- **Promotes Eye Health:** Focusing on distant objects helps relax eye muscles and reduce the risk of developing vision-related issues.
- **Boosts Productivity:** By reminding users to take breaks, Blink Eye helps maintain high levels of focus and motivation. Short breaks lead to better mental clarity and energy, making it easier to tackle tasks efficiently.
- **Increases Workflow Efficiency:** With the break time reminder feature, Blink Eye ensures you're working in manageable intervals, reducing burnout and fatigue. It can help optimize your work routine by encouraging timely rest periods.
- **Encourages Healthy Habits:** Establishing a routine of taking regular breaks fosters a healthier work-life balance and prevents overexertion, improving your overall well-being.
- **Customizable Break Times:** Set your own intervals and break lengths to match your personal productivity style, making Blink Eye a versatile tool for users with different work schedules.
- **Time Management Tool:** Blink Eye can double as a productivity tool by encouraging structured break times, enhancing time management for both work and personal tasks.
