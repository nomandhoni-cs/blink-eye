# Why I Feel My Eyes Are Dry Lately?

Are your eyes feeling dry, itchy and irritated lately? Do you have a dry eye syndrome (CVS) or repetitive strain injuries (RSI)? Or are you just feeling a little irritated?

## Calm Down, Calm Down!

Hey there! Let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Feeling like your eyes are dry and scratchy can be unsettling, but don’t worry. It happens to the best of us, and often, it’s something manageable. Let’s take a deep breath and chat about this like old friends, shall we?

## What Could Be Going On?

Dry eyes can result from several reasons, some as simple as spending too much time staring at screens (hello, Netflix marathons and late-night work sessions). Other culprits might include:

- **Lack of blinking:** When we’re focused on screens, we blink less often, reducing natural eye lubrication.
- **Dry indoor air:** Heating or air conditioning can suck the moisture out of your eyes.
- **Age and hormonal changes:** Yep, sometimes it’s just biology being biology.
- **Environmental factors:** Wind, smoke, or even your favorite scented candle might be irritating your eyes.
- **Underlying conditions:** Allergies or certain medications might also contribute to dryness.

## Easy Home Remedies to Soothe Your Eyes

You don’t have to rush to a doctor just yet. Here are a few simple remedies you can try at home:

1. **Follow the 20-20-20 Rule:** For every 20 minutes of screen time, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This reduces strain and gives your eyes a break.
2. **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to keep your body—and eyes—moisturized.
3. **Blink more often:** Sounds obvious, but consciously blinking during screen time can do wonders.
4. **Use a humidifier:** Add moisture back into the air, especially in dry indoor spaces.
5. **Artificial tears:** Over-the-counter eye drops can provide immediate relief. Look for preservative-free options.
6. **Cool compress:** Gently place a clean, cool cloth over your closed eyes for instant soothing.

## When to See a Doctor

If your symptoms persist despite trying these remedies, or if you experience redness, severe pain, or vision changes, it’s time to consult a professional. Chronic dry eye could be a sign of an underlying condition that requires medical attention.

Remember, your eyes are precious, and a little care can go a long way. Don’t ignore the signs, and give your peepers the love they deserve!
